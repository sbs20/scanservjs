    --adv-paper-protect Default|Off|On [On]
        Request scanner to predict jams in the ADF using improved sensors
    --bgcolor Default|White|Black [Default]
        Set color of background for scans. May conflict with overscan option
    --dropoutcolor Default|Red|Green|Blue [Default]
        One-pass scanners use only one color during gray or binary scanning,
        useful for colored paper or ink
    --buffermode Default|Off|On [Off]

    --overscan Default|Off|On [Default]
        Collect a few mm of background on top side of scan, before paper
        enters ADF, and increase maximum scan area beyond paper size, to allow
        collection on remaining sides. May conflict with bgcolor option
    --sleeptimer 0..60 (in steps of 1) [0]
        Time in minutes until the internal power supply switches to sleep mode

        off. Will be rounded to nearest 15 minutes. Zero means never power off.
    --lowmemory[=(yes|no)] [no]
        Limit driver memory usage for use in embedded systems. Causes some
        duplex transfers to alternate sides on each call to sane_read. Value of
        option 'side' can be used to determine correct image. This option
        should only be used with custom front-end software.
    --side[=(yes|no)] [no] [read-only]
        Tells which side (0=front, 1=back) of a duplex scan the next call to
        sane_read will return.
